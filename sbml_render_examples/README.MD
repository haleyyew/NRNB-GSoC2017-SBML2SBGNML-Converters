The `Render_example.xml` example was taken from the **Illustrative examples of the Render syntax** section of the SBML Level 3 Version 1 'render' specification. All other examples were created by haleyyew to test the capabilities of the 'render' package.
Render_example_01,
Render_example_02,
Render_example_03,
Render_example_04,
were created using JSBML. Render_example_reactionGlyph, Render_example_localRenderOnly, Render_example_generalGlyph were modified from `Render_example.xml`.
The images in `example_glyphs` were outdated and were for testing purposes only.
