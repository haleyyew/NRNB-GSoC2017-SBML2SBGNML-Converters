All .xml files were converted from the examples in `/sbgnml_af_examples`. `compartment_extended.sbgn` was converted using 2 converters: the `SBML 'qual' <- SBGN AF` converter's output is `compartment_extended_SBML+qual.xml`, and the `SBML 'layout'+'render' <- SBGN AF` converter's output is `compartment_extended_SBML.xml`. The images in `examples_converted_images_old` are outdated.
